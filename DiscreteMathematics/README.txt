These projects were created as tools for finding discrete mathematic outputs.  These outputs include set operations, subset results, 
summations, propositional logic, propositional combinations, and functions between two sets.  These programs are commented and explained
with more detail within the code.  

Note: these programs were written in Python 2.7.
